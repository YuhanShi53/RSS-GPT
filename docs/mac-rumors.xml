<br />

<br />
The Charging Station has a compact design with an upright adjustable Qi2 charging platform, which supports an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in portrait or landscape orientation so you can use StandBy. The Apple Watch charger is tucked behind the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charger, and the AirPods charge at the base of the device.

<br />
The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models require a 20W or higher charger for fast charging with USB-C or 30W for fast charging over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, and Lululook has the perfect 65W three-port GaN charger option.

<title>Apple Watch's New Sleep Apnea Detection Feature Approved in Canada</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-feature-approved-in-canada/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-feature-approved-in-canada/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：  
苹果手表系列10、9和Ultra 2获得了加拿大的睡眠呼吸暂停检测功能批准。该功能利用加速度计监测腕部微小运动，识别与呼吸模式中断相关的扰动。用户可通过iPhone的健康应用查看睡眠干扰情况。  

总结：  
1. 健康加拿大批准Apple Watch系列10、9和Ultra 2的watchOS 11，新增睡眠呼吸暂停检测功能。  
2. 该功能在本月早些时候首次推出，现获准在加拿大提供。  
3. 睡眠呼吸暂停是一种严重的睡眠障碍，表现为呼吸反复中断。  
4. Apple Watch利用腕部加速度计监测与正常呼吸模式中断相关的小运动。  
5. 如果多晚频繁发生这些扰动，可能与睡眠呼吸暂停相关。  
6. Apple表示该功能基于先进的机器学习和临床数据集开发，并已通过有效验证。  
7. 该功能旨在帮助未诊断的成年人检测中度到重度睡眠呼吸暂停的迹象。  
8. 用户可通过iPhone健康应用查看其夜间呼吸干扰情况，分类为“升高”或“未升高”。 <div>
Health Canada this week published approval of watchOS 11's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/sleep-apnea-detection-details/">sleep apnea detection feature</a> on the Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. The feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-feature-150-countries/">launched in the U.S. and over 150 other countries and regions</a> earlier this month, and Apple is now permitted to make the feature available in Canada.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965154" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sleep-apnea-detection-apple-watch.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
It is unclear when Apple will expand the feature to Canada.
<br />

<br />
Sleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts while they sleep. The detection feature uses the Apple Watch's accelerometer to "monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns." If these disturbances occur frequently over multiple nights, they may be associated with sleep apnea, according to Apple.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968471" height="294" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Health-Canada-Apple-Watch-Sleep-Apnea.jpg" width="779" />
<br />
Apple says the feature was developed using "advanced machine learning" and an "extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests," and then validated in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/health/pdf/sleep-apnea/Sleep_Apnea_Notifications_on_Apple_Watch_September_2024.pdf">clinical study</a>. The feature is intended to detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults who have not already been diagnosed with the disorder, according to the company.
<br />

<br />
Apple Watch users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app on the iPhone, with disturbances classified as "elevated" or "not elevated."
<br />

There are a couple of handy new feature controls coming, too.
<br />

<br />
While not all Apple Intelligence features will be available immediately, iOS 18.1 introduces several enhancements that aim to make your iPhone smarter and more intuitive. Below, we've listed 15 new things your iPhone will be able to do when the update rolls out next month.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Reset Your Control Center</h2>
<br />
<img alt="control center" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968362" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/reset-control-center.jpg" width="4377" />
<br />
With iOS 18, Apple made the Control Center thoroughly customizable, but there's no way to roll back your changes if things get messy. Fortunately, iOS 18.1 introduces a simple way to start fresh. In Settings ➝ Control Center, you'll find a new option to reset your Control Center to its default layout. This feature is perfect if you've made too many customizations and want to return to a clean slate without manually rearranging everything.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Take Selfies With Camera Control</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967792" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-selfie-camera-control.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
Camera Control gets a selfie upgrade in iOS 18.1. Now, you can switch to the front-facing camera without touching your screen. Simply open the Camera app with a press of the Camera Control button, then swipe on the button to cycle through lens options. Look for the person icon at the top to activate the selfie camera, making it easier to capture that perfect self-portrait.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Proofread Your Text</h2>
<br />
<img alt="notes" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968363" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/proofread-notes.jpg" width="4377" />
<br />
Embarrassing typos could be a thing of the past. iOS 18.1's new Writing Tools feature includes a powerful proofreading function. It not only checks for spelling and grammar errors but also suggests improvements in word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a single tap or review them one by one, complete with explanations.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Rewrite Your Text</h2>
<br />
<img alt="notes" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968377" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/rewrite-your-text.jpg" width="4377" />
<br />
Need to change the tone of your message? The new Rewrite tool is capable of doing just that. Whether you want your text to sound more friendly, professional, or concise, this feature can adjust your writing style without altering the core content. It's like having a personal editor at your fingertips, helping you communicate more effectively in any situation.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Summarize Long Emails</h2>
<br />
<img alt="mail" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968365" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/summarize-mail.jpg" width="2898" />
<br />
If you frequently suffer from inbox overload, this should be a welcome feature. When you receive a lengthy email, you'll now see a "Summarize" button that lets Apple Intelligence create a concise overview. Choose from options like a brief paragraph, key points, or even a bulleted list. This tool makes it easier to quickly grasp the essence of important messages without reading every word. Plus, your inbox now displays a brief AI-generated summary instead of the first few lines of each email, helping you prioritize your responses more efficiently.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Answer Apple Product Questions</h2>
<br />
<img alt="siri" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968368" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-product-knowledge.jpeg" width="5472" />
<br />
Your iPhone becomes a knowledgeable Apple expert with iOS 18.1. Siri can now tap into a vast database of product information, helping you understand device features, locate settings, and even provide tutorials on how to complete tasks. It's like having Apple Support built right into your device, available whenever you need it.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Offer Smart Replies to Emails and Messages</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
Communication gets a boost with Smart Reply in iOS 18.1. When you receive an email or message, your iPhone will analyze the content and suggest contextually relevant responses. These quick-tap options make it easy to reply promptly and appropriately, saving you time and effort in your daily correspondence.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Summarize Multiple Message Notifications</h2>
<br />
<img alt="messages" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968371" height="1696" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/summarize-notifications.jpg" width="3018" />
<br />
Catching up on group chats is set to get a lot easier. iOS 18.1 can summarize multiple message notifications on your Lock Screen, giving you a quick overview without the need to open the app. This feature helps you stay on top of conversations without getting overwhelmed by notification overload.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Create Memory Movies From a Short Description</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960208" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-memory-maker.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
Relive your favorite moments with ease using the new Memory Movie feature. Simply provide a description like "My cat in 2024" or "Orlando in the summer," and your iPhone will automatically select relevant photos and choose appropriate music. You can further customize the mood and add specific scenes, turning your memories into beautiful short films with minimal effort.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Remove Unwanted Objects From Photos</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962933" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Clean-Up-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
Perfect your photos with the new Clean Up tool. This feature allows you to easily remove unwanted objects from your images. Whether it's a photobomber or a distracting element in the background, you can now tap, circle, or brush over the object to make it disappear. The tool is smart enough to preserve important elements, ensuring your main subjects remain intact.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Summarize Your Audio Transcripts</h2>
<br />
<img alt="notes" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968370" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/summarize-transcript.jpg" width="2898" />
<br />
Turn long recordings into digestible content with the new transcription feature. When you record audio in apps like Notes, your iPhone can now provide a transcript along with a summary. This is particularly useful for capturing and distilling information from lectures, meetings, or interviews, making it easier to review and share key points.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Reduce Your Interruptions</h2>
<br />
<img alt="notifications" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968372" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-apple-intelligence-notification-summary.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
Take control of your notifications with the new Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode. This intelligent feature filters your alerts, showing you only the most important notifications that require immediate attention. It should come in handy for when you need to concentrate but don't want to miss crucial information.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Record Your Phone Calls</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" height="3047" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" width="5416" />
<br />
iOS 18.1 introduces Phone call recording. During a call, you'll see a record button in the upper left corner of the display. Tap it, and after notifying all participants, the call will be recorded. These recordings are stored in the Notes app, where you can access transcripts and AI-generated summaries, making it easy to review important conversations.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Summarize Web Articles</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
Reading long articles is about to get easier with this Safari improvement. When using Reader Mode, you can now tap a button to have Apple Intelligence summarize the article for you. This feature quickly distills the main points, allowing you to grasp the essence of the content without reading every word.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Generate Apple Intelligence Reports</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960227" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-report.jpg" width="2000" />

<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-in-more-countries/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-in-more-countries/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：苹果在其线上翻新商店首次在澳大利亚、日本和新加坡推出低价Apple Pencil，价格较全新款式便宜约15%。该产品具有USB-C接口，但不支持无线充电和压力感应。

<br><br>总结：
1. 苹果今日在在线翻新商店新增低价Apple Pencil，覆盖澳大利亚、日本和新加坡三个国家，之前在加拿大等地已上线。
2. 翻新版Pencil均价较全新版本便宜约15%，例如澳大利亚售价$119，原价$139。
3. 该款Apple Pencil设计类似于Apple Pencil 2和Pro，具有隐形USB-C接口，但不支持无线充电与配对。
4. 该产品可磁性附着于任意带USB-C端口的iPad，缺少压感和双击切换工具功能。
5. 苹果表示，其翻新产品经过全面功能测试、清洁和检测，翻新Pencil将以简单的白色包装盒和翻新标签销售。 <div>
Apple today added the lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port to its online refurbished store for the first time in three more countries: Australia, Japan, and Singapore. Availability first began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-us/">in the U.S.</a>, Canada, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/">some European countries</a> in July.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" height="1102" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" width="1960" />
<br />
The refurbished model is discounted by around 15% in each country. For example, pricing is set at &#36;119 in Australia, down from &#36;139 brand new.
<br />

<br />
Originally released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on/">in November 2023</a>, the lower-cost Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing with a USB-C cable. It attaches magnetically to any iPad with a USB-C port, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing. It also lacks pressure sensitivity and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools.
<br />

<br />
Apple says its refurbished products undergo full functionality testing, and are subject to a thorough cleaning process and inspection. The refurbished Apple Pencils are repackaged in a plainer white box with a refurbished label.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-in-more-countries/">USB-C Apple Pencil Now Available Refurbished in Three More Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/usb-c-apple-pencil-now-available-refurbished-in-three-more-countries.2438349/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

Apple action-comedy film "<a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/wolfs/umc.cmc.c3xhu25rw4jxxxzq4oio6snu">Wolfs</a>," featuring Hollywood stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney, premiered today exclusively on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+. The movie was originally slated for a wide theatrical release, but premiered on the streaming service today following a limited theatrical run last week.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968383" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/wolfs-movie.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
Directed by Jon Watts, known for the recent Spider-Man trilogy, "Wolfs" follows two professional fixers played by Pitt and Clooney who must work together to cover up a high-profile crime. The star-studded cast also includes Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, and Richard Kind.
<br />

<br />
Despite positive reception from critics, Apple made the unexpected decision to pull "Wolfs" from wide theatrical release last month. The company has not publicly explained its reasoning for the change in strategy, although industry speculation suggests it may be related to the underwhelming box office performance of some recent Apple Original films.
<br />

<br />
Apple's shift in approach for "Wolfs" reflects a broader reconsideration of its theatrical release plans. Another upcoming film, "Blitz," is also set for a limited theatrical run before streaming. Currently, Apple has only one movie, the Formula One drama "F1" (also starring Brad Pitt), scheduled for a wide theatrical release in June 2025.
<br />

<br />
Despite the move, Apple appears to remain committed to producing high-profile content. Matt Dentler, head of features at Apple Original Films, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/apple-sets-wolfs-sequel-jon-watts-george-clooney-brad-pitt-drama-pivots-limited-theatrical-before-apple-tv-streaming-bow-1236034117/">recently described</a> "Wolfs" as a "big event movie" and announced that a sequel is already in development.
<br />

<br />
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br />
"Wolfs" is produced by Clooney's Smokehouse Pictures and Pitt's Plan B Entertainment in partnership with Apple. The film is <a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/wolfs/umc.cmc.c3xhu25rw4jxxxzq4oio6snu">now streaming</a> for all &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ subscribers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/wolfs-george-clooney-brad-pitt-apple-tv/">New Film &#039;Wolfs&#039; Starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney on Apple TV+</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-film-wolfs-starring-brad-pitt-and-george-clooney-on-apple-tv.2438347/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>Make Calls Faster With This New iOS 18 Feature</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-t9-dialing-ios-phone-app/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-t9-dialing-ios-phone-app/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要:  
苹果在iOS 18中引入了T9拨号功能，使用户通过数字键盘快速找到和拨打联系人。此外，还可直接从拨号键盘添加新联系人和搜索最近通话记录。

<br><br>  
要点总结:  
1. iOS 18引入T9拨号支持，提升拨打联系人的效率。  
2. T9拨号是基于数字键盘和字母映射的预测文本技术。  
3. 用户可以在拨号界面输入联系人姓名，通过数字键直接拨号。  
4. 如果有多个匹配，用户可查看更多匹配选项。  
5. 新增功能允许用户从拨号界面直接添加联系人。  
6. 用户可以搜索最近通话记录，快速找到联系信息。 <div>
Apple has finally brought T9 dialing support to the iPhone with iOS 18, a feature long available on Android devices. This addition to the Phone app allows users to quickly find and call contacts using the number pad, which can streamline the process of making calls if you've used the feature before.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955980" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/t9-dialing-phone-keypad-ios-18.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads. Each number key (2-9) on a T9 keypad is mapped to a set of letters. For example, the key "2" corresponds to "ABC," "3" to "DEF," and so on.
<br />

<br />
The best match appears first above the keypad, and tapping the person's name will call them. If there are several possible matches in your contacts, they can be revealed as a list by tapping "X more..." below the first match. Taken together, the new options should enable faster calling.
<br />

<br />
Here's how to use T9 dialing in iOS 18:
<br />
<ol>
<br />
  <li>Open the Phone app and tap the keypad tab.</li>
<br />
  <li>Type the contact's name using the number keys (e.g., for "Dad," press 3-2-3).</li>
<br />
  <li>Above the keypad, tap the matching contact to call, or "X more..." to see additional matches.</li>
<br />
</ol>This feature aims to speed up the calling process, especially for users who prefer the number pad or have difficulty navigating contact lists. It's particularly useful for one-handed operation or when quick dialing is necessary.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Add Contacts From the Keypad</h2>
<br />
iOS 18 also introduces new options for adding numbers to contacts directly from the keypad. When entering a new number:
<br />
<ol>
<br />
  <li>After entering a new number, tap the new button in the top-left corner of the keypad screen.</li>
<br />
  <li>Choose "Create New Contact" or "Add to Existing Contact" as needed.</li>
<br />
</ol><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955984" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/t9-phone-dialing-ios-18-keypad.jpg" width="4377" />
<br />
That's all there is to it. In addition to the new features described above, Apple has also added the ability to search recent calls. Simply look for the search field at the top of your recent calls list and start typing into it to find the contact or number you're looking for.<br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-t9-dialing-ios-phone-app/">Make Calls Faster With This New iOS 18 Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/make-calls-faster-with-this-new-ios-18-feature.2438337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<br />
Kuo claims the most significant change in the new model will be the inclusion of Apple's M5 chip, a substantial upgrade from the M2 chip found in the current Vision Pro. The processor boost is expected to significantly improve device's computing power, with a particular emphasis on integrated Apple Intelligence features.
<br />

<br />
Despite the upgraded internals, Kuo reports that other hardware specifications and the overall design of the Vision Pro will remain largely unchanged. This approach could help Apple manage production costs, although the price point is expected to stay close to the current &#36;3,499 starting price of the first-generation model.
<br />

<br />
Kuo emphasized that if this new version creates compelling use cases, it could push Apple's spatial computing platform closer to mainstream adoption. He also speculates on the potential integration of advanced AI models, such as text-to-video capabilities similar to OpenAI's Sora, which could dramatically enhance the Vision Pro experience. 
<br />

<br />
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">reports</a> that Apple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence features to the Vision Pro headset in the future. While the device is capable of running on-device AI functions such as writing tools, notification summaries, and an upgraded Siri, these features are not expected to arrive in 2024. Instead, Apple may be reserving the Apple Intelligence integration for visionOS 3, potentially launching in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/kuo-apple-vision-pro-m5-chip-apple-intelligence/">Kuo: 2025 Apple Vision Pro to Get M5 Chip and Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2025-apple-vision-pro-to-get-m5-chip-and-apple-intelligence.2438327/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要:  
iFixit对iPhone 16 Pro和Pro Max进行了拆解，指出两款手机使用传统的电池粘合剂，Pro Max不具备金属电池外壳，修理性评分为7分。

<br><br>  
1. iFixit展示了iPhone 16 Pro和Pro Max的拆解过程，强调电池移除的新方法。
2. 16 Pro系列与iPhone 16采用传统粘合剂，电池更易取出但没有金属外壳。
3. LiDAR Scanner更易于维修，由于其位置更为便利。
4. mmWave天线位置变更，使得设备顶部腾出了空间，但信号表现可能受金属框架影响。
5. USB-C端口移除过程更为简化，逻辑板也可以通过去掉上扬声器组件轻松拔出。
6. 内部使用Qualcomm SDX71M调制解调器，而非传言中的X75。
7. 整体设计优化提升了修理方便性，iFixit给出了7分维修性评分。 <div>
Earlier this week, repair site iFixit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ifixit-iphone-16-teardown/">took apart the iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Plus to demonstrate the new battery removal process that uses electricity for adhesive removal, and today, iFixit is back with a teardown of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max.
<br />

<br />
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br />
Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models do not have the same simplified battery removal process as the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, with Apple instead using traditional stretch release adhesive for its pricier iPhones. It's still easier to get inside, though, because you can do so through the back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> rather than the display, which can be easily damaged.
<br />

<br />
Apple encased the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; battery in metal like the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max does not have the metal casing around its battery, and it's not clear why. iFixit called the decision to use the metal-encased battery in just the 16 Pro and not the 16 Pro Max "perplexing."
<br />

<br />
The LiDAR Scanner is more accessible, which makes it easier to access for repairs. In prior Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, it was under the main camera assembly. The camera modules are almost identical, but not quite interchangeable due to a different cable length and a screw positioned in two separate locations inside each model.
<br />

<br />
Apple moved the mmWave antenna to make room for the Camera Control button, and in the 16 Pro models, it's in a hollowed out space near the top of the device. iFixit says that mmWave signal could still suffer due to the titanium frame of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models.
<br />

<br />
USB-C port removal is "massively" simplified, but iFixit points out that Apple does not sell replacement USB-C ports. The logic board can also be pulled out with only the removal of the upper speaker assembly, which is a major improvement to the design.
<br />

<br />
Notably, the teardown revealed that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are using a Qualcomm SDX71M modem, which is a custom version of the SDX70M modem used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models. Rumors had suggested the Pro models would include the Qualcomm X75 modem, which doesn't appear to be the case.
<br />

<br />
iFixit gave the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models a repairability score of 7 out of 10 due to the design changes and the availability of repair manuals.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/iphone-16-pro-teardown-ifixit/">iFixit Teardown Provides Look Inside iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-teardown-provides-look-inside-iphone-16-pro-and-iphone-16-pro-max.2438298/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>iPad 11: What's Next for Apple's Most Affordable Tablet</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-11/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-11/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要: 苹果正在研发低成本iPad的更新，预计将保持10.9英寸显示屏和USB-C接口，同时可能升级至A16芯片，支持Wi-Fi 6E。定价预计维持在349美元起，可能在10月发布。

<br><br>总结:
1. 苹果正在更新自2022年未刷新过的低成本iPad。
2. 设计上将保持10.9英寸的全屏效果和USB-C接口，可能推出新颜色。
3. 当前的A14芯片将升级到A16芯片，提升性能和电池续航。
4. 支持Wi-Fi 6E，提高网络速度。
5. 预计价格将维持在349美元起，或有存储提升的可能性。
6. 新款iPad可能在10月发布，但显示屏出货延迟，具体时间仍不确定。
7. 建议消费者等候更新型号以获得更好的性价比。 <div>
Apple is working on an update for the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, which hasn't been refreshed since 2022. As an entry-level product, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; doesn't get a lot of attention and it's not often the focus of rumors, but we've heard a little bit about what might be coming to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904791" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ipad-green-2.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<br />
Apple overhauled the look of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in 2022, introducing a 10.9-inch all-display design and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> power button, so we're not expecting any further design changes at this point in time.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869882" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Pink.jpg" width="2000" />
<br />
Apple will likely stick with the 10.9-inch display and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Air-like design, but we could get new colors. Current colors include silver, yellow, pink, and blue. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; already has a USB-C port, which will stick around, and it will continue to support the USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="a-series_chip">A-Series Chip</h2>
<br />
The current 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has an A14 chip that was first used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 lineup, and it's getting outdated. The logical choice for the next &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is the A16 that was used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, but if Apple wants to make Apple Intelligence as accessible as possible, an A17 Pro chip or A18 chip isn't out of the question.
<br />

<br />
Of course, adding Apple Intelligence support would also necessitate much more memory, and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is currently limited to 4GB, so it might just be too expensive for Apple to give it that functionality while also keeping the price affordable.
<br />

<br />
Either way, the A16 will be a major improvement even if it doesn't support Apple Intelligence. It'll be faster and more efficient, so battery life could potentially be improved.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="other_updates">Other Updates</h2>
<br />
Apple has been updating most of its products with Wi-Fi 6E or better, so we can expect Wi-Fi 6E support for the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The current model supports Wi-Fi 6, so it is not compatible with the faster 6GHz band that's available with Wi-Fi 6E routers. 
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<br />
We haven't heard rumors of any kind of cost increase for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11, so we're still expecting pricing to start at &#36;349 for 64GB of storage. Apple has been bumping some minimum storage options in recent years, so there's a chance we could see a boost to 128GB of storage without a cost increase, but nothing has been rumored.
<br />

<br />
Apple only sells the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in 64GB and 256GB configurations right now.
<br />
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2>
<br />
Apple is rumored to be holding an event in October to unveil new M4 Macs and a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>, so it's possible we'll see the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; then.
<br />

<br />
Rumors about the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11's launch date have been wishy washy, though. Analyst Ross Young recently said that display shipments for the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/display-shipments-macbook-air-ipad-october/">wouldn't start</a> until October, which is late for an October debut and actually more appropriate for a 2025 launch.
<br />

<br />
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has said Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-working-on-redesigned-ipad-magic-keyboard/">new Magic Keyboard</a> accessory for the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and/or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> which is expected to come out by the middle of 2025. It may not make sense to release the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11 until that accessory is ready, as Apple doesn't typically split up accessory and device launches.
<br />

<br />
Of course, if it's actually an accessory solely for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, the keyboard might not have an impact on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11 launch date at all.
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="buying_advice">Buying Advice</h2>
<br />
If you're planning to get a low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and you can wait, we recommend holding off for the new model. The current version is two years old at this point, and the chip inside is even older. You'll get the most out of your money if you wait for an update.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-11/">iPad 11: What&#039;s Next for Apple&#039;s Most Affordable Tablet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-11-whats-next-for-apples-most-affordable-tablet.2438296/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>Apple's Upcoming Smart Home Accessory Could Feature 'Squarish' Display</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要: 苹果正在研发一种新的智能家居设备，可能是一款方形显示的控制中心，具备手势识别、个性化请求和媒体播放功能，预计将在2025年推出，并可能搭载A18芯片。

<br><br>苹果正在开发一款名为HomeAccessory的智能家居设备，该设备将作为家居控制中心，能够控制Matter设备。其设计为方形显示，与现有产品如iPad和HomePod形成区隔。此次设备配备内置摄像头，能够识别手势以及区分不同用户以提供个性化服务。此外，它可运行应用、播放媒体，并作为家庭音响的接收器。早前的代码泄露显示它将运行tvOS的变体，并可能搭载A18芯片，这提供了良好的技术基础，以支持未来的智能功能。根据传闻，该设备最早将在2025年推出，9to5Mac指出可能会在明年春季发布。 <div>
Apple is rumored to be working on a sort of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/">iPad-like smart display</a> that will serve as a home hub for controlling your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and Matter devices. We've been hearing rumors about the device for the last couple of years, and now there's some new information about its potential design.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
Called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">the "HomeAccessory" internally</a>, the upcoming smart home device has a "squarish display," according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/26/apples-long-awaited-homeaccessory-could-have-square-display-a18-chip-for-ai-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The square display would make the product distinct from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, which has a more rectangular display. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has previously described the smart home hub as "iPad-like" with features adopted from the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but he's also described a separate &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen, which seems to be simpler.
<br />

<br />
<em>9to5Mac</em> claims it is unclear whether the square design will make it into the final product, which also seems to have a built-in camera for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>. The device includes a camera that is able to identify hand gestures from afar, and it can tell one person apart from another for personalized requests. While it can run apps and play media like the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, it will also serve as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> receiver like the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
<em>MacRumors</em> spotted signs of the HomeAccessory in Apple's backend code earlier this year. It is a product that is distinct from Apple's other home devices, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; and the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. It seems to run a variant of tvOS much like the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, and the test version we've seen described is equipped with an A18 chip, so there is a possibility that it might not be too far off from launching.
<br />

<br />
With an A18 chip or later, Apple's smart home product would be able to run Apple Intelligence features, and it would support the smarter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that Apple plans to introduce in 2025. Prior rumors have said that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">will debut in 2025</a> at the earliest, and <em>9to5Mac</em> says it could come next spring. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/">Apple Smart Home Display</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/">Apple&#039;s Upcoming Smart Home Accessory Could Feature &#039;Squarish&#039; Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-upcoming-smart-home-accessory-could-feature-squarish-display.2438268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Firmware</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a305/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a305/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要: 苹果发布了针对AirPods Pro 2的新固件更新，版本号为7A305，增加未来耳机和听力测试功能的基础。

<br><br>总结要点:
1. 苹果为AirPods Pro 2（USB-C和Lightning型号）发布了新固件更新。
2. 更新后的固件版本号为7A305，较之前的7A302有所提升。
3. 目前尚未透露更新内容，可能为将来加入的听力辅助功能做准备。
4. 苹果已获得FDA批准，为AirPods Pro 2提供听力辅助功能。
5. 用户无法手动更新AirPods，固件通常在放入充电盒并连接iOS设备或Mac时自动更新。 <div>
Apple today released a new firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, with the software available for both the USB-C and Lightning models. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 firmware has a build number of 7A305, up from the 7A302 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/apple-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a302/">released earlier in September</a>.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825981" height="1306" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg" width="2322" />
<br />
There is no word yet on what's included in the firmware, but Apple is planning to add hearing aid and hearing test features to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 in the not too distant future.
<br />

<br />
The firmware update could potentially lay the groundwork for those capabilities ahead of when the full feature set comes out in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> update. Apple has already received FDA approval for the hearing aid functionality for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2.
<br />

<br />
Apple doesn't have a way to manually upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air when the AirPods are in a charging case and connected to an iOS device or Mac.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a305/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Firmware</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware.2438264/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>Apple Preparing iOS 18.0.1 Update for iPhone Following Several Bugs</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-preparing-ios-18-0-1/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-preparing-ios-18-0-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：苹果正在内部测试iOS 18.0.1更新，主要关注错误修复。预计在下周末发布，解决特定问题，并为后续的iOS 18.1做好准备。

<br><br>总结：
1. 苹果内部测试iOS 18.0.1，日志已确认该版本。
2. 更新预计集中在错误修复，可能解决Watch共享面板导致的崩溃问题及与M4芯片相关问题。
3. iOS 18.0.1的发布预计在下周末，为下一个大版本iOS 18.1做准备。
4. iOS 18.1已在测试版中推出，包含首个Apple Intelligence功能，如写作工具和通知摘要。
5. Apple Intelligence功能将适用于iPhone 15 Pro、iPhone 15 Pro Max及所有iPhone 16型号。 <div>
Apple appears to be internally testing iOS 18.0.1 for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software update in our website's analytics this week. Our logs have accurately revealed many iOS versions before they were released.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968305" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Generic-iOS-18.0.1-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
We expect iOS 18.0.1 to be a minor update focused on bug fixes. Issues that could be addressed with the update include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ios-18-touchscreen-issues-reported/">touchscreen issues affecting the iPhone 16 series</a> and some older models, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/18/ios-18-messages-app-crash/">an iMessage bug</a> where a shared Apple Watch face can cause the app to repeatedly crash, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/apple-working-to-fix-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro-issue/">iPadOS 18 bricking some iPad Pro units</a> with the M4 chip.
<br />

<br />
It is unclear when iOS 18.0.1 will be released, but our best guess is the update will be available towards the end of next week at the latest.
<br />

<br />
iOS 18.0.1 will precede iOS 18.1, which Apple previously announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/when-will-ios-18-1-be-released/">will be released in October</a>. Already available in beta, iOS 18.1 includes the first Apple Intelligence features for the iPhone, including writing tools, notification summaries, and more. Apple Intelligence is available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and any iPhone 16 model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-preparing-ios-18-0-1/">Apple Preparing iOS 18.0.1 Update for iPhone Following Several Bugs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-18-0-1-update-for-iphone-following-several-bugs.2438253/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<div> 摘要:  
iMore宣布停止发布新内容，现有内容将保留。该网站经历了17年多元化的发展，曾吸引多位知名科技记者，近期在在线出版行业面临挑战后被关闭。  

<br><br>  
1. iMore于周三宣布停止在其网站上发布新内容，现有内容将保留。  
2. 最后挑选的编辑Gerald Lynch在告别博客中表示，iMore在在线出版的关键时刻关闭，面临读者注意力竞争加剧与AI影响。  
3. iMore是Future PLC旗下第二个被关闭的知名科技网站，原因是该公司正在关闭一些非核心或低增长的资产。  
4. iMore自2007年以PhoneDifferent.com名称启动，经历名称变更后于2012年更名为iMore，并吸引了多位知名科技记者。  
5. 该网站的过去和现任团队，包括Lynch、Lory Gil等，在Apple相关报道方面做出贡献。  
6. 向所有iMore团队成员表达良好祝愿。 <div>
Apple-focused publication iMore on Wednesday sadly <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple/one-more-thing-goodbye-from-imore">announced</a> that it will no longer be publishing new content on its website. Existing content published by the website will remain available indefinitely, it said.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968284" height="675" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iMore-Logo-Large.jpeg" width="1200" />
<br />
"iMore leaves the stage at a pivotal crossroads for online publishing, where the battle for readers' time and attention is more demanding than ever before, and the aforementioned AI advances and search discovery methods further complicate the playing field," wrote iMore's final editor-in-chief Gerald Lynch, in a farewell blog post.
<br />

<br />
iMore is the second well-known technology website owned by Future PLC to be shuttered in as many months, following <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell">AnandTech in August</a>. In a <a href="https://cms.futureplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024.09.26-Trading-statement-FINAL.pdf">financial disclosure</a> today, the company announced that it is closing a "number of non-core or low to no growth assets," including a "small number of print and digital brands."
<br />

<br />
Future PLC also owns Android Central, TechRadar, Tom's Guide, Windows Central, and more. 
<br />

<br />
<h2>iMore's History</h2>
<br />
The website that eventually became iMore has operated under various names for over 17 years. The site originally launched as PhoneDifferent.com in 2007, merged with and took the name of TheiPhoneBlog.com in 2008, and abbreviated its domain name to TiPb.com in 2010. In 2012, the website rebranded as iMore.
<br />

<br />
iMore has been home to a number of well-known technology journalists over the years, including Dieter Bohn, Rene Ritchie, Serenity Caldwell, and many others. Bohn went on to become a founding member of The Verge in 2011, and he now works at Google. Ritchie left iMore in 2020 after 12 years at the website, and he now works for YouTube. Caldwell worked for iMore between 2014 and 2018, and she now works at Apple.
<br />

<br />
Ritchie was an especially prominent voice at iMore, having published numerous op-eds about Apple products over his years at the website.
<br />

<br />
iMore had a dedicated team of writers in more recent years, including Lynch, Lory Gil, Stephen Warwick, Joe Wituschek, Oliver Haslam, Tammy Rogers, John-Anthony Disotto, Daryl Baxter, James Bentley, Karen Freeman, and others.
<br />

<br />
From one Apple blog to another, we wish the iMore team past and present all the best.<br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-blog-imore-shutting-down/">Apple Blog iMore Shutting Down: &#039;One More Thing… Goodbye&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blog-imore-shutting-down-one-more-thing…-goodbye.2438231/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>Disney+ Account Sharing Crackdown Goes Global With Paid Sharing Plan</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/disney-crackdown-account-sharing-paid-plan/</link>
<guid>https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/disney-crackdown-account-sharing-paid-plan/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要: Disney+推出“付费共享”计划，旨在限制账户使用于单一家庭，同时提供“额外会员”功能供用户分享账户。

<br><br>总结: 
1. Disney+宣布“付费共享”计划，限制账户仅限单一家庭使用。
2. 新增“额外会员”功能，适用于希望与家庭外的人分享账户的用户。
3. “额外会员”费用为每月6.99美元或9.99美元（根据订阅计划）。
4. 将增加的成员必须年满18岁，并且居住在同一国家。
5. 用户在外出时仍可访问服务，需验证身份。
6. 可转移个人资料到新订阅，保留观看历史和设置。
7. 此举旨在增强收入和订阅增长，受Netflix成功案例启发。
8. 将于本月底在多个国家和地区全面实施。 <div>
Disney+ has announced a new "Paid Sharing" program across multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe, as its global account sharing crackdown kicks up a gear. The move, which was announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown/">earlier this year</a> by Disney CEO Bob Iger, aims to boost revenue and subscriber growth for the streaming service.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968214" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/disney-plus-account-sharing-crackdown.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
Similar to Netflix's approach, the new system restricts account usage to members of a single household. Disney+ <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/">defines a household</a> as "a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there."
<br />

<br />
To accommodate users who wish to share their account with individuals outside their household, Disney+ has introduced an "Extra Member" add-on feature. <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-price">In the US</a>, this option costs an additional &#36;6.99 per month for Disney+ Basic subscriptions and an extra &#36;9.99 per month for Disney+ Premium subscriptions. <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/en-GB/article/disneyplus-price">UK pricing</a> has been set at £3.99, £4.99, and £4.99 per month for Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium plans, respectively.
<br />

<br />
It's worth noting that the Extra Member feature comes with some limitations: Account holders can only add one extra member, who must be 18 or older and reside in the same country, and the added member can only stream to one device at a time.
<br />

<br />
For those who frequently travel, Disney+ will still allow account holders to access the service when away from home. Users encountering access issues can verify their identity through a one-time passcode sent to the account's associated email address.
<br />

<br />
Disney+ is also offering the option to transfer eligible profiles to new subscriptions, allowing users to retain their watch history and settings if they choose to create their own account. 
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968220" height="425" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/disney-plus-paid-sharing.jpg" width="768" />
<br />
The move follows Netflix adopting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/netflix-password-crackdown-subscriber-increase/">similar restrictions in 2023</a>, which the company said had led to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-pace/">significant subscriber growth</a>. Disney aims to replicate this success, with Iger previously stating that the company needs to turn its streaming business into a growth business. Those comments came after Disney's streaming division experienced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/disney-password-sharing-crackdown/">&#36;512 million loss</a> in the third fiscal quarter of 2023.
<br />

<br />
The full rollout of the password sharing restrictions across the US, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be completed by the end of the month, potentially impacting a large swathe of the company's more than 110 million subscribers worldwide.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/disney-crackdown-account-sharing-paid-plan/">Disney+ Account Sharing Crackdown Goes Global With Paid Sharing Plan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-account-sharing-crackdown-goes-global-with-paid-sharing-plan.2438210/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />

<title>Avoid Vehicle Motion Sickness With This New iOS 18 Feature</title>

<div> 摘要：  
Apple在iOS 18中新增了“车辆运动提示”功能，旨在减少车内乘客使用iPhone或iPad时的晕动症，通过屏幕边缘的动画点指示车辆运动变化，以减少视觉与感觉之间的冲突。

要点总结：  
1. Apple在iOS 18中推出了“车辆运动提示”功能，旨在缓解车内使用设备时的运动病。  
2. 研究表明，运动病通常是由于视觉与感觉的矛盾引起的。  
3. 该功能通过屏幕边缘的动画点表示车辆运动的实时变化。  
4. 用户可以在“设置”中开启该功能，选择“开启”或“自动”。  
5. “开启”选项会持续显示动画点，而“自动”选项仅在检测到车辆运动时显示。  
6. 还可以通过控制中心快捷开启此功能，增加“车辆运动提示”按钮。  
7. 该功能的有效性因人而异，用户期待在旅途中舒适使用设备。 <div>
In iOS 18, Apple added several new accessibility features, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among car passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an iPhone or iPad.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950825" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vehicle-motion-cues.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ while riding in a moving vehicle.
<br />

<br />
Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains: 
<br />
<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>The following steps show you how to enable Vehicle Motion Cues in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18:
<br />
<ol><li>Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad.</li>
<br />
<li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li>
<br />
<li>Tap <strong>Motion</strong>.
<br />
<img alt="settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968202" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/1vehicle-motion-cues-ios-18.jpg" width="2898" />
<br />
<li>Tap <strong>Show Vehicle Motion Cues</strong>.</li>
<br />
<li>Choose <strong>On</strong> or <strong>Automatic</strong>.
<br />
<img alt="settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968203" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/2vehicle-motion-cues-ios-18.jpg" width="2898" /></ol>Note that choosing <strong>On</strong> shows the dots until you turn them off, while choosing <strong>Automatic</strong> shows the dots when vehicle motion is detected and hides them when the motion stops. If you turned on the feature, you should now see the motion cues – roving little dots around the edges of your iPhone or iPad screen. If you opted for the automatic activation, wait until you're in a moving vehicle for the cues to appear. 
<br />

<br />
<h2>Enable Vehicle Motion Cues From Control Center</h2>
<br />
Alternatively, you can add a Vehicle Motion Cues button to the Control Center. Here's how:
<br />
	<ol><li>Invoke Control Center with a diagonal swipe from the top-right corner of the screen (or with a swipe up from the bottom if your iPhone or iPad has a Home button).</li>
<br />
	<li>Press and hold on any space in the Control Center to enter the customize mode, then tap <strong>Add a Control</strong> at the bottom.</li>
<br />
	<li>Swipe up to the "Vision Accessibility" controls or search "Motion" in the input field, then choose <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong>.
<br />
<img alt="control center" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968204" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/vehicle-motion-cues-control-center.jpg" width="2898" />
<br />
	<li>Press and hold a space in the Control Center to exit the customize mode.</li>
<br />
	<li>Tap the <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong> button, then choose <strong>On</strong> or <strong>Only in Vehicle</strong>.
<br />
<img alt="control center" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968205" height="2796" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/control-center-vehicle-motion-cues.jpg" width="2898" /></ol>There's no guarantee that the feature will work for everyone, but with a bit of luck, it will allow you or your kids to look at what's on the screen for the duration of the journey without starting to feel nauseous.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-motion-sickness-prevention/">Avoid Vehicle Motion Sickness With This New iOS 18 Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/avoid-vehicle-motion-sickness-with-this-new-ios-18-feature.2438200/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />
