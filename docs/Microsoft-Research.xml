<p>Members of the research community at Microsoft work continuously to advance their respective fields. <em>Abstracts</em> brings its audience to the cutting edge with them through short, compelling conversations about new and noteworthy achievements. </p>



<p>In this episode, Microsoft senior principal researchers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chrishaw/">Chris Hawblitzel</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lorch/">Jay Lorch</a> join host Amber Tingle to discuss <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/verus-a-practical-foundation-for-systems-verification/">“Verus: A Practical Foundation for Systems Verification,”</a> which received the Distinguished Artifact Award at this year’s Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, or SOSP. In their research, Hawblitzel, Lorch, and their coauthors leverage advances in programming languages and formal verification with two aims. The first aim is to help make software verification more accessible for systems developers so they can demonstrate their code will behave as intended. The second aim is to provide the research community with sound groundwork to tackle the application of formal verification to large, complex systems. </p>

<p>[MUSIC]&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>AMBER TINGLE: </strong>Welcome to <em>Abstracts</em>, a Microsoft Research Podcast that puts the spotlight on world-class research <em>in brief</em>. I’m Amber Tingle. In this series, members of the research community at Microsoft give us a quick snapshot—or a <em>podcast abstract</em>—of their new and noteworthy papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[MUSIC FADES]&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our guests today are Chris Hawblitzel and Jay Lorch. They are both senior principal researchers at Microsoft and two of the coauthors on a paper called “Verus: A Practical Foundation for Systems Verification.” This work received the Distinguished Artifact Award at the 30th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, also known as <em>SOSP</em>, which is happening right now in Austin, Texas. Chris and Jay, thank you for joining us today for <em>Abstracts</em> and congratulations!</p>



<p><strong>JAY LORCH: </strong>Thank you for having us.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>CHRIS HAWBLITZEL: </strong>Glad to be here.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TINGLE: </strong>Chris, let&#8217;s start with an overview. What problem does this research address, and why is Verus something that the broader research community should know about?&nbsp;</p>



				</span>
				<span class="show-more-show-less-toggleable-content" id="show-more-show-less-toggle-1">
					



<p><strong>HAWBLITZEL: </strong>So what we&#8217;re trying to address is a very simple problem where we&#8217;re trying to help developers write software that doesn&#8217;t have bugs in it. And we&#8217;re trying to provide a tool with Verus that will help developers show that their code actually behaves the way it&#8217;s supposed to; it obeys some sort of specification for what the program is supposed to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TINGLE: </strong>How does this publication build on or differ from other research in this field, including your previous Verus-related work?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HAWBLITZEL: </strong>So formal verification is a process where you write down what it is that you want your program to do in mathematical terms. So if you&#8217;re writing an algorithm to sort a list, for example, you might say that the output of this algorithm should be a new list that is a rearrangement of the elements of the old list, but now this rearrangement should be in sorted order. So you can write that down using standard mathematics. And now given that mathematical specification, the challenge is to prove that your piece of software written in a particular language, like Java or C# or Rust, actually generates an output that meets that mathematical specification. So this idea of using verification to prove that your software obeys some sort of specification, this has been around for a long time, so, you know, even Alan Turing talked about ways of doing this many, many decades ago. The challenge has always been that it&#8217;s really hard to develop these proofs for any large piece of software. It simply takes a long time for a human being to write down a proof of correctness of their software. And so what we&#8217;re trying to do is to build on earlier work in verification and recent developments in programming languages to try to make this as easy as possible and to try to make it as accessible to ordinary software developers as possible. So we&#8217;ve been using existing tools. There are automated theorem provers—one of them from Microsoft Research called Z3—where you give it a mathematical formula and ask it to prove that the formula is valid. We&#8217;re building on that. And we&#8217;re also taking a lot of inspiration from tools developed at Microsoft Research and elsewhere, like Dafny and F* and so on, that we&#8217;ve used in the past for our previous verification projects. And we&#8217;re trying to take ideas from those and make them accessible to developers who are using common programming languages. In this case, the Rust programming language is what we&#8217;re focusing on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TINGLE: </strong>Jay, could you describe your methodology for us and maybe share a bit about how you and your coauthors tested the robustness of Verus.</p>



<p><strong>LORCH: </strong>So the question we really want to answer is, <em>is</em> Verus suitable for systems programming? So that means a variety of things. Is it amenable to a variety of kinds of software that you want to build as part of a system? Is it usable by developers? Can they produce compact proofs? <em>And</em> can they get timely feedback about those proofs? Can the verifier tell you quickly that your proof is correct or, if it&#8217;s wrong, that it&#8217;s wrong and guide you to fix it? So the main two methodological techniques we used were millibenchmarks and full systems. So the millibenchmarks are small pieces of programs that have been verified by other tools in the past, and we built them in Verus and compared to what other tools would do to find whether we could improve usability. And we found generally that we could verify the same things but with more compact proofs and proofs that would give much snappier feedback. The difference between one second and 10 seconds might not seem a lot, but when you&#8217;re writing code and working with the verifier, it&#8217;s much nicer to get immediate feedback about what is wrong with your proof so you can say, oh, what about this? And it can say, oh, well, I still see a problem there. And you could say, OK, let me fix that. As opposed to waiting 10, 20 seconds between each such query<strong> </strong>to the verifier. So the millibenchmarks helped us evaluate that. And the <em>macro</em>benchmarks, the building entire systems, we built a couple of distributed systems that had been verified before—a key value store and a node replication system—to show that you could do them more effectively and with less verification time. We also built some new systems, a verified OS page table, a memory allocator, and a persistent memory append-only log.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TINGLE: </strong>Chris, the paper mentions that successfully verifying system software has required—you actually use the word <em>heroic</em> to describe the developer effort. Thinking of those heroes in the developer community and perhaps others, what real-world impact do you expect Verus to have? What kind of gains are we talking about here?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HAWBLITZEL: </strong>Yeah, so I think, you know, traditionally verification or this formal software verification that we&#8217;re doing has been considered a little bit of a pie-in-the-sky research agenda. Something that people have applied to small research problems but has not necessarily had a real-world impact before. And so I think it&#8217;s just, you know, recently, in the last 10 or 15 years, that we started to see a change in this and started to see verified software actually deployed in practice. So on one of our previous projects, we worked on verifying the cryptographic primitives that people use when, say, they browse the web or something and their data is encrypted. So in these cryptographic primitives, there&#8217;s a very clear specification for exactly what bytes you&#8217;re supposed to produce when you encrypt some data. And the challenge is just writing software that actually performs those operations and does so efficiently. So in one of our previous projects that we worked on called HACL* and EverCrypt, we verified some of the most commonly used and efficient cryptographic primitives for things like encryption and hashing and so on. And these are things that are actually used on a day-to-day basis. So we, kind of, took from that experience that the tools that we&#8217;re building are getting ready for prime time here. We can actually verify software that is security critical, reliability critical, and is in use. So some of the things that Jay just mentioned, like verifying, you know, persistent memory storage systems and so on, those are the things that we&#8217;re looking at next for software that would really benefit from reliability and where we can formally prove that your data that&#8217;s written to disk is read correctly back from disk and not lost during a crash, for example. So that&#8217;s the kind of software that we&#8217;re looking to verify to try to have a real-world impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LORCH: </strong>The way I see the real-world impact, is it going to enable Microsoft to deal with a couple of challenges that are severe and increasing in scale? So the first challenge is attackers, and the second challenge is the vast scale at which we operate. There&#8217;s a lot of hackers out there with a lot of resources that are trying to get through our defenses, and every bug that we have offers them purchase, and techniques like this, that can get rid of bugs, allow us to deal with that increasing attacker capability. The other challenge we have is scale. We have billions of customers. We have vast amounts of data and compute power. And when you have a bug that you&#8217;ve <em>thoroughly</em> tested but then you run it on millions of computers over decades, those rare bugs eventually crop up. So they become a problem, and traditional testing has a lot of difficulty finding those. And this technology, which enables us to reason about the <em>infinite</em> possibilities in a finite amount of time and observe all possible ways that the system can go wrong and make sure that it can deal with them, that enables us to deal with the vast scale that Microsoft operates on today.</p>



<p><strong>HAWBLITZEL: </strong>Yeah, and I think this is an important point that differentiates us from testing. Traditionally, you find a bug when you <em>see</em> that bug happen in running software. With formal verification, we&#8217;re catching the bugs <em>before</em> you run the software at all. We&#8217;re trying to prove that on all possible inputs, on all possible executions of the software, these bugs will not happen, and it&#8217;s much cheaper to fix bugs before you&#8217;ve deployed the software that has bugs, before attackers have tried to exploit those bugs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TINGLE: </strong>So, Jay, ideally, what would you like our listeners and your fellow SOSP conference attendees to tell their colleagues about Verus? What&#8217;s the key takeaway here?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LORCH: </strong>I<strong> </strong>think the key takeaway is that it is possible now to build software without bugs, to build systems code that is going to obey its specification on all possible inputs <em>always</em>. We have that technology. And this is possible <em>now</em> because a lot of technology has advanced to the point where we can use it. So for one thing, there&#8217;s advances in programming languages. People are moving from C to Rust. They&#8217;ve discovered that you can get the high performance that you want for systems code without having to sacrifice the ability to reason about ownership and lifetimes, concurrency. The other thing that we build on is advances in computer-aided theorem proving. So we can really make compact and quick-to-verify mathematical descriptions of all possible behaviors of a program and get fast answers that allow us to rapidly turn around proof challenges from developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TINGLE: </strong>Well, finally, Chris, what are some of the open questions or future opportunities for formal software verification research, and what might you and your collaborators tackle next? I heard a few of the things earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HAWBLITZEL: </strong>Yes, I think despite, you know, the effort that we and many other researchers have put into trying to make these tools more accessible, trying to make them easier to use, there still is a lot of work to prove a piece of software correct, even with advanced state-of-the-art tools. And so we&#8217;re still going to keep trying to push to make that easier. Trying to figure out how to automate the process better. There&#8217;s a lot of interest right now in artificial intelligence for trying to help with this, especially if you think about artificial intelligence actually <em>writing</em> software. You ask it to write a piece of software to do a particular task, and it generates some C code or some Rust code or some Java code, and then you hope that that&#8217;s correct because it could have generated any sort of code that performs the right thing or does total nonsense. So it would be really great going forward if when we ask AI to develop software, we also expect it to create a proof that the software is correct and does what the user asked for. We’ve started working on some projects, and we found that the AI is not quite there yet for realistic code. It can do small examples this way. But I think this is still a very large challenge going forward that could have a large payoff in the future if we can get AI to develop software <em>and</em> prove that the software is correct.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LORCH: </strong>Yeah, I see there&#8217;s a lot of synergy between—<em>potential</em> synergy—between AI and verification. Artificial intelligence can solve one of the key challenges of verification, namely making it easy for developers to write that code. And verification can solve one of the key challenges of AI, which is hallucinations, synthesizing code that is not correct, and Verus can verify that that code actually is correct.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Three icons that represent (left to right) ecology and environment, economics, and technology for emerging markets." class="wp-image-1098936" height="788" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2024/10/MicroGrid-BlogHeroFeature-1400x788-1.jpg" width="1400" /></figure>



<p>The rise of affordable small-scale renewable energy, like rooftop solar panels, is reshaping energy systems around the world. This shift away from fossil fuel-powered grids creates new opportunities for energy distribution that prioritize decentralized energy ownership and community empowerment. Despite this progress, centralized energy systems still dominate, often failing to provide vulnerable communities with reliable, affordable renewable energy. In response, Microsoft researchers are collaborating with local communities to explore how AI can enable community-scale energy solutions focused on energy availability and equity as well as decarbonization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-powered-microgrids-support-resilient-communities">AI-powered microgrids support resilient communities</h2>



<p>Microgrids, small and localized energy systems, hold promise as a solution to the challenges of centralized energy systems. These microgrids can operate independently from the larger grid, providing participants with resilience and control. Figure 1 shows how these systems integrate renewable energy sources and storage to efficiently manage local energy needs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Figure 1: The image shows a microgrid system with interconnected assets, including rooftop solar panels, battery storage locations, electric vehicle chargers, wind turbines, and large solar farms, all supporting a small community and tied to the central power grid.  " class="wp-image-1090167" height="858" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2024/10/microgrids-Fig1.jpg" width="1600" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1. An example of the decentralized nature of a microgrid power system</figcaption></figure>



<p>AI improves energy reliability by integrating data about energy consumption, market prices, and weather forecasts, necessary when using wind and solar power, which rely on weather conditions. Advanced forecasting predicts renewable energy availability, while AI-driven analytics determine when to generate, store, or sell electricity. This increases efficiency and stabilizes the grid by balancing supply and demand.</p>



<p>When powered by AI, microgrids can also contribute to energy equity. In many rural parts of the US, flat-rate billing models are still common, often leading to unfair pricing. AI-enabled microgrids provide an alternative by allowing communities to pay only for the energy they use. By analyzing consumption patterns, AI can ensure optimized distribution that promotes equitable pricing and access. These systems also improve resilience during crises, enabling communities to manage energy distribution more effectively and reduce reliance on centralized utilities. AI allows microgrids to predict energy demands, identify system vulnerabilities, and recover quickly during outages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluating-ai-s-impact-on-microgrid-efficiency-and-equity">Evaluating AI&#8217;s impact on microgrid efficiency and equity</h2>



<p>To explore AI’s potential in improving efficiency and equity in energy management, a team of Microsoft researchers collaborated with community organizations on simulations and a case study. They built a tabletop simulator to test whether AI could effectively determine when to generate, store, or sell electricity based on real-time data. The AI model was optimized for resilience and efficiency, using reinforcement learning to control grid and battery processes, enabling microgrids adapt to changing energy conditions and market dynamics.</p>



<p>This simulation used a theoretical model with external data to show how an AI-driven microgrid could autonomously buy and sell energy based on strategic design parameters. By controlling when the battery is charged and discharged based on energy production and consumption patterns, the model maximized efficiency and maintained local power availability. Figure 2 shows the AI-controlled grid&#8217;s optimal decisions using open-source data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), serving as a proof of concept (PoC) for AI-driven microgrids operating under real-world conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Figure 2 (A): Graph depicting peak and off-peak net power bought or sold over one week using simulations of the AI controller on historical CAISO data. The graph shows a direct correlation that when solar is available then more power is bought than sold, whereas, during nighttime the controller relies on stored energy in battery to power consumption, making fewer transactions  

Figure 2 (B) The graph shows battery levels on a simulated AI controller for the historical CAISO data. During peak hours, the battery discharges as reserves are sold, while solar power supplies the load. At night, the battery conserves power, minimizing purchases and optimizing reserves for daytime selling.

Working closely with the <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://ccogatl.org/hub/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Vicars Community Center (VCC) resilience hub<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, they aim to address challenges faced by the community due to rapid development West Atlanta, like many Atlanta neighborhoods, faces rising housing prices and energy costs that disproportionately affect long-time residents. Communities relying on centralized grids are more vulnerable to outages, with slow recovery times, highlighting systemic inequalities in energy distribution.</p>



<p>The VCC resilience hub is tackling these issues by helping to establish a solar microgrid for the <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.wawa-online.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">West Atlanta Watershed Alliance<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a> (WAWA) community farm and surrounding neighborhoods. Microsoft researchers and collaborators are integrating AI into the microgrid to achieve energy savings, improve resilience, and create local job opportunities. Figure 3 shows the VCC resilience hub and WAWA community farm powered by the microgrid, highlighting key infrastructure for installing distributed energy resources (DERs).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="project-phases">Project phases</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading h4" id="co-innovation-design">Co-innovation design</h3>



<p>Microsoft researchers, architects, and community partners held a participatory design session with state and utility representatives to define the project&#8217;s mission and key metrics. The CDC’s Social Vulnerability index informed the site selection, supporting the project’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading h4" id="renewables-and-microgrid-siting">Renewables and microgrid siting</h3>



<p>A renewable siting survey conducted by community partners identified the VCC as a key resilience hub for solar panel and battery installation.</p>



<p>To deliver these benefits, the site first needed upgrades. Older homes required energy-efficiency improvements, such as electrical upgrades and better insulation, before they could be integrated into the microgrid. As a PoC, the team collaborated with community partners to modernize an older home with inefficient energy consumption. Sensors were installed to track energy usage and environmental conditions (Figure 4).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Figure 4: A graph showing estimated cost of electricity per day based on a legacy household in West Atlanta through kilowatt-hour usage between July 29, 2024 and August 13, 2023.

The analysis confirmed issues like high radon levels and energy drains from outdated appliances. Guided by these findings, the team upgraded the house into a “smart home” where AI monitors energy and environmental conditions, enabling it to join the microgrid and making it eligible for <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://www.usgbc.org/leed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">LEED certification<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading h4" id="microgrid-simulation-phase">Microgrid simulation phase</h3>



<p>To prepare the AI-powered microgrid, Microsoft researchers built a simplified tabletop prototype simulating the setup using real data from the design and siting phases. This prototype demonstrated the control mechanism’s ability to manage DERs—solar panels, batteries, and appliances—and the interface between the microgrid and the larger grid. Figure 6 shows the tabletop model during prototyping.</p>

<p>Erica Holloman-Hill, director of WAWA, CEO of Ayika Solutions and owner of the PoC home, reflected: “This study helped me understand how our home’s outdated condition affects our quality of life. Upgrading homes like mine could make a significant difference. Thanks to partnerships like this one, controlling and sharing the electricity the community generates is within reach, highlighting the potential of AI-supported technologies like microgrids for communities like ours.”</p>



<p>Building on the simulation’s success, the VCC resilience hub and local organizations are continuing to install solar panels to power the microgrid. AI will play a key role in siting and controlling the system as it expands. Efforts are also underway to establish sustainable financing models and assess homes for modernization to enable broader participation in the microgrid.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-a-path-to-equity-and-resilience">AI: A path to equity and resilience</h2>



<p>The transition to decentralized microgrids offers new opportunities for energy efficiency, with AI playing a critical role in managing these systems. Yet additional efforts are needed for communities to fully realize these benefits. Residents of aging homes are burdened with outdated wiring, inefficient appliances, and poor insulation—factors that drive up energy costs. Their dependence on centralized grids offers little relief, underscoring the need for community-focused energy solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The West Atlanta project illustrates AI’s potential to create resilient, equitable, community-driven energy systems, paving the way for a more inclusive and sustainable future. Microsoft researchers are continuing to collaborate with local organizations to promote smarter energy management.</p>
