<p>Transforming raw data into meaningful visuals, such as charts, is key to uncovering hidden trends and valuable insights, but even with advances in AI-powered tools, this process remains complex. Integrating AI into the iterative nature of the data visualization process is particularly challenging, as data analysts often struggle to describe complicated tasks in a single text prompt while lacking the direct control of traditional tools. This highlights the need for smarter, more intuitive solutions that combine AI’s precision with the flexibility of hands-on methods.</p>

Data Formulator’s UI</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="creating-and-refining-charts-with-the-concept-encoding-shelf-and-data-threads">Creating and refining charts with the Concept Encoding Shelf and data threads</h2>



<p>With Data Formulator, data analysts can now create charts from scratch or select from existing designs through <em>data threads</em>. The UI features a pane called the “Concept Encoding Shelf,” where users can build their chart by dragging various data fields into it and defining them or by creating new ones. A large language model (LLM) on the backend processes this input, generating the necessary code to produce the visual and updating the data threads for future use. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Figure 2: This figure shows the user experience workflow in Data Formulator. On the left it shows Data Threads, and the user clicks a line chart that visualizes the renewable percentage of 20 countries and expands it in the main panel. In the middle it shows “Concept Encoding Shelf”, and the user provides an instruction “Show only top 5 CO2 emission countries”. On the right it shows the result produced from running the user instruction with AI: the result is a table with three columns “Year” “Entity” “Renewable Percentage” and int contains only top 5 CO2 countries’ values; a line chart that only contains these five countries trends is also generated. The line chart is added to data threads. " class="wp-image-1083879" height="838" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2024/09/Figure-2-Data-Formulator-flow.png" width="2346" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2. To create a new chart, users can select a previously created chart from the data threads and then use a combination of UI elements and language to describe their intent.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Data threads enable users to review and modify charts they created previously. This iterative process streamlines the editing and refinement process, as the LLM adapts past code to new contexts. Without this feature, users would need to provide more detailed prompts to recreate designs from scratch. This iterative mechanism also allows users to continue updating their charts until they’re satisfied.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Figure 3: This figure illustrates how Data Formulator’s data threads work. On the left side, it shows two data threads, one is the derivation process of electricity produced from each energy source from each country from 2000 to 2020, the other is the thread showing that the user derives the renewable percentage of each country per year followed by a line chart that shows the rankings of these countries. The figure illustrates that each of the plots is backed by a python data transformation code to derive data appropriate to the user instruction. On the right it shows actions users can take in local data threads: (a) the user can click and rerun a previous instruction, (b) the user can provide a new instruction to follow up, (c) the user can click the previous card and revise instruction and rerun. " class="wp-image-1083891" height="1240" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2024/09/Figure-3-Data-Threads.png" width="2790" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 3: Data Formulator’s data threads support complex navigation, quick editing, and the rerunning of previous instructions.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-formulator-s-framework">Data Formulator’s framework</h2>



<p>Data Formulator’s architecture separates data transformation from chart configuration, improving both the user experience and AI performance. Upon receiving user specifications, the system follows a three-step process: (1) it generates a Vega-Lite script, which defines how data is visualized; (2) it instructs the AI to handle data transformation; and (3) it creates the chart using the converted data, as illustrated in Figure 4.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Figure 4: This figure shows data formulator architecture. The left side shows user’s chart specification with Year on x-axis, rank on y-axis, Entity on color with instruction “rank by renewable percentage”. In the first step, Data Formulator generates a Vega-Lite line chart template with field names. In step 2, Data Formulator compiles a prompt containing “system prompt”, “Context (data fields + sample data + dialog history)” and “Goal (user instruction + expected fields)”, and AI takes this prompt to generate a python code to transform the data. In step 3, Data Formulator combines the data and the Vega-Lite spec to create a line chart that shows ranking of the countries from 2000 to 2020.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="implications-and-looking-forward">Implications and looking forward</h2>



<p>Refining how users interact with AI-powered tools is essential for improving how they communicate their requirements, paving the way for more efficient and effective collaboration. By integrating UI elements and natural language input, we designed Data Formulator to let users to define their visualization needs with precision, leading to better results and reducing the need for multiple clarifications.</p>



<p>While Data Formulator addresses some challenges in data transformation and visualization authoring, others remain. For example, how can AI assist in cleaning unstructured data without losing critical information? And how can it help users define clear data analysis goals when starting with ambiguous or undefined objectives? We’re actively investigating these research questions and invite you to contribute by building on the <a class="msr-external-link glyph-append glyph-append-open-in-new-tab glyph-append-xsmall" href="https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Data Formulator codebase<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading h2" id="probts-benchmarking-point-and-distributional-forecasting-across-diverse-prediction-horizons">ProbTS: Benchmarking Point and Distributional Forecasting across Diverse Prediction Horizons</h3>



<p>Time-series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on previously observed data points over time. It has extensive applications for traffic flow, renewable energy, retail, finance, and climate, among other uses. For these applications, it is crucial to provide forecasts across different prediction horizons, addressing both short- and long-term planning needs. Many decision-making processes also require not only point forecasts to quantify planning efficiency but also robust distributional estimations to manage uncertainty effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delivering precise point and distributional forecasts across a spectrum of prediction horizons is a significant challenge. Prior research on developing deep learning models for time-series forecasting has often concentrated on isolated aspects, such as long-term point forecasting or short-term probabilistic estimations. This may result in skewed methodological choices and hinder the adaptability of these models to uncharted scenarios. While there is a rising trend in developing universal forecasting models, a thorough understanding of their advantages and drawbacks is still lacking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent paper: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/probts-benchmarking-point-and-distributional-forecasting-across-diverse-prediction-horizons/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ProbTS: Benchmarking Point and Distributional Forecasting across Diverse Prediction Horizons</a>, researchers from Microsoft and external collaborators present a platform to evaluate these fundamental forecasting needs and to conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of related recent studies. They examine the latest models for universal time-series forecasting and discover that their analyses of methodological strengths and weaknesses are also applicable to these universal models. They then outline the limitations inherent in current research and underscore several avenues for future exploration.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading h2" id="syndl-a-large-scale-synthetic-test-collection-for-passage-retrieval">SynDL: A Large-Scale Synthetic Test Collection for Passage Retrieval</h3>



<p>Information retrieval (IR) involves identifying and retrieving recorded data that is relevant&nbsp;to an information need. Large-scale test collections play a crucial role in IR research. However, existing IR research studies are commonly developed on small-scale datasets that rely on human assessors for relevance judgments – a time-intensive and expensive process. Recent studies have shown the strong capability of large language models (LLMs) in producing reliable relevance judgments with human accuracy but at a greatly reduced cost.</p>



<p>In a recent paper: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/syndl-a-large-scale-synthetic-test-collection-for-passage-retrieval/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SynDL: A Large-Scale Synthetic Test Collection for Passage Retrieval<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, researchers from Microsoft and external colleagues address the missing large-scale ad-hoc document retrieval dataset.

Such a test collection includes more than 1,900 test queries from previous tracks. The researchers compare system evaluation with past human labels and show that their synthetically created large-scale test collection can lead to highly correlated system rankings.&nbsp;</p>

Requests for different tasks with distinct input and output characteristics are often served concurrently at a single model instance, which can lead to spikes in end-to-end latency, time to generate the first token, and time between tokens (in the case of a streaming request). Understanding the interplay between requests of different characteristics is important for optimizing the end-to-end performance during LLM inference.</p>



<p>In a recent preprint, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/intelligent-router-for-llm-workloads-improving-performance-through-workload-aware-scheduling/">Intelligent Router for LLM Workloads: Improving Performance Through Workload-Aware Scheduling</a>, researchers from Microsoft propose a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for data-driven and workload-aware scheduling. This router leverages a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads to schedule queries across LLM instances and achieve over 11% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches.</p>
